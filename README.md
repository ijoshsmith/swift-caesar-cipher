# Caesar cipher in Swift

An implementation of the Caesar cipher in Swift using a functional programming style.

Refer to the CaeserCipher class to see how text can be enciphered using the same encryption technique used to protect Julius Caesar's personal correspondence. That class also contains a `decipher` method which uses statistical analysis to attempt to decrypt a message.

This page on Wikipedia explains the Caesar cipher, and how to crack it, in detail:
