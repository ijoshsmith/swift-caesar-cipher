# Caesar cipher in Swift

An implementation of the Caesar cipher in Swift using a functional programming style.

Refer to the [CaeserCipher](/caesar/CaesarCipher.swift) class to see how text can be enciphered, via the `encipher` method, using the same encryption technique used to protect Julius Caesar's personal correspondence. The class also contains a `decipher` method which uses statistical analysis to attempt to decrypt a message.

This page on Wikipedia explains the Caesar cipher, and how to crack it, in detail:
